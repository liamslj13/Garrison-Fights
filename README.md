# Garrison-Fights
is an indie game that was created for the Winter Melon Jam 2023.
This game jam took place from 12/28 12AM UTC until 12/31 12AM UTC.
As of now, this repository houses *only* the source code for the project, but when a working build is complete it will be updated with the entire thing, as well as a link to play.

This project was made with game engine Godot 4.

## Objective
The goal of the game is keep Garrison alive for as long as possible. To achieve this you must evade the enemies and use your ability charms to thwart their attacks.

## Gameplay
An example playthrough of the game can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45j4MsjzOiY).
